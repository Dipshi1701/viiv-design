# Welcome to VIIV Design

This guide will help you get started with the VIIV Design project. It’s written for regular people, not experts. If you can open files and use a web browser, you’re in the right place.

## What is This?
VIIV Design is a simple front-end template using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You don’t need anything special to use it—just open the files and go.

## Project Contents
Here’s how things are set up:

```
viiv-design/
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── styles.css        # Main styles
│   ├── img/                  # Images and icons

## Getting Started
1. Download the whole folder as a ZIP, or if you use git, run:
   `git clone https://github.com/Dipshi1701/viiv-design.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. No servers or extra software needed.
3. To make changes, open any file in an editor like VS Code or Notepad, edit, save, and refresh your browser to see your changes.

## How the Search and Gen AI Work
This project includes a search that looks for answers in documents and product data. If you allow it, the AI assistant also tries to give a short, helpful summary above the regular results, and shows which sources it used. Your original question is sent to the AI service; nothing else personal is sent.

The code that handles search and AI is in `assets/js/viiv-search.js`. You can change what it does there if needed.

## For Beginners
- You can’t break anything permanently. If you make a mistake, you can always re-download the files.
- No installation or setup is needed - your browser does all the work.
- To see any change, just save your file and reload the browser window.
